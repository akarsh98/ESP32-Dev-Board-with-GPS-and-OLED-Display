This PCB is a GPS position tracking device, which shows all the relevant data on an OLED display.
The Pcb uses:
1) ESP32 as the microcontroller
2) Reyax GPS module
3) OLED SSD13086 0.96' display
4) Other basic components.

So, in short, this project has an ESP32 which can give WiFi/Bluetooth functionality, OLED display and GPS module. Possibilities with the code are endless. I have also added a prototyping area where you can add sensors or other components to the ESP32 which is also accessible.
